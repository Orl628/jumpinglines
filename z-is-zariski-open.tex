\begin{proposition}
	The set $Z_{\text{gen}}$ is Zariski open. Its complement Z is the union
	\[
		\Supp(R^1 \pushf{\phi}\pullb{p} V_{k}(-b^{(k)}-1)) \cup
		\Supp(R^1 \pushf{\phi}(\pullb{p} V_{k}(-b^{(k)})\dual)).
	\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	We begin by characterizing the set $\generallocus$ via cohomology. Let $t\in \GGr(1,\schemeofsurfaces)$, write $V_{k,t}=\bigoplus_{i=1}^r \mc{O}(b_i)$ and $b\coloneqq b^{(k)}$. We have $t\in \generallocus$ if and only if $b\leq b_i \leq b+1$ for all $i$, which holds if and only if
	$
	H^1(P_t, V_{k,t}(-b-1))
	=
	H^1(P_t, V_{k,t}(-b)\dual)
	=0.
	$

	Next, we want to apply the Cohomology and Base Change Theorem \cite[{}28.1.6]{vakil-algebraic-geometry} to the map 
	$\phi \from P \to \GGr(1,\schemeofsurfaces)$, which is a $\PP^1$-bundle, proper and flat. The last property ensures that locally free sheaves on $P$ are flat over $\GGr(1,\schemeofsurfaces)$.

	For all $t\in \GGr(1,\schemeofsurfaces)$ we have
	$
	h^2(P_t, \pullb{p}V_{k,t}(-b-1)) = 0
	\text{ and }
	h^2(P_t,\pullb{p}V_{k,t}(-b)\dual)=0.
	$
	Since the sheaves $\pullb{p}V_{k,t}(-b-1)$ and $\pullb{p}V_{k,t}(-b)\dual$ are locally free and coherent, we have 
	\[(R^1 \pushf{\phi}\pullb{p} V_{k}(-b-1))_t = H^1(P_t,V_{k,t}(-b-1))\]
	\text{ and }
	\[
	(R^1 \pushf{\phi}(\pullb{p} V_{k}(-b)\dual))_t = H^1(P_t,V_{k,t}(-b)\dual).
	\]

	By the previous characterization, we have
	\[
		Z =
		\Supp(R^1 \pushf{\phi}\pullb{p} V_{k}(-b-1)) \cup
		\Supp(R^1 \pushf{\phi}(\pullb{p} V_{k}(-b)\dual)),
	\]
	which is a Zariski closed set.
\end{proof}
